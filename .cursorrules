# Cursor IDE Assistant Rules for One-click-cleaning-of-C-drive Project

## Language for User-Facing Text

All user-facing strings in the application UI and console output
(e.g., button labels, window titles, messages, echo statements in batch files)
must be in Chinese
Internal logging messages and code comments can be in English or Chinese
but prefer Chinese for new log messages that might be user-relevant during debugging
